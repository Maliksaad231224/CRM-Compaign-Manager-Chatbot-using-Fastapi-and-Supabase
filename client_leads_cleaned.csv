I discussed internally and we have no issues with the Italian Tax Credits. However, as I mentioned might be the case on our call, the size here doesn't quite fit our typical parameters.   For future reference, we could look at roughly a $2–3M check if we’re ficing tax credits only. If there’s additional collateral involved, such as distribution presales that you’d also like ficed, we’d likely look at a minimum of around $5M, given the added complexity.   So unfortunately, this specific case probably isn’t a fit for us, but we’d definitely like to stay involved for future opportunities that align more closely.  Also, a quick clarification as structure: we wouldn’t provide traditional gap ficing in cases where tax credits are already part of the budget or pledged elsewhere, since they wouldn’t be available as collateral. We’d structure the investment as an advance or loan directly against the tax credits or presales themselves. Not sure if I made this clear on the call so I wanted to reiterate.
